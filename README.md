An easy implementation of the game "Pong" that I made to learn the basics of Python with the help of a tutorial.
Pong is one of the games that are made during @tockyedtech's python course. To create the graphical interface I used the turtle module.
Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas.
To manage the audio of the game I used the os module with which I was able to interface with the operating system.
